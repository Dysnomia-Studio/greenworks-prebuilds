# Greenworks prebuilds

I'm providing automated builds for greenworks including a combination of Electron, Node.js, NW.js, Mac, Linux and Windows.
Most common versions/abi are built.

# Editing the configuration
## Linux/Mac
[.travis.yml](/.travis.yml)

## Windows
[appveyor.yml](/appveyor.yml)

## Logs
Logs are available at [Travis](https://travis-ci.com/ElectronForConstruct/greenworks-prebuilds) and [AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/armaldio/greenworks-prebuilds)

## Caution
Not all builds are tested. They may crash or be unavailable.
